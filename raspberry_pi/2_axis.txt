- wrap angle problem somewhat fixed, wrap angles are accurate more or less to +- 2 degrees
- current problem being addressed is inconsistant axial end position after each pass. At high
	translational speeds this may be caused by slippage of timing belt pulley on
	motor shaft, and at low speeds this may be from turnaround time (recognized by a rounded
	path during direction shifts); however, both of these are yet to be validated or given
	deep thought. These results are from test.py
	- It seems that on test_jig.py the axial end positions move in and radial offset position
	changes until a steady-state is reached this accounts for offset_time equation though which
	may amplify the problem. 
	- Problem is yet to be looked into on wrap angles > 30 degrees

- wrap angle is pretty accurate. could use feedback to check speed of motors to make sure wrap angle 
	is good. Not sure if this is necessary though, but would make system more robust.
- total wrap equation has not been validated, not sure if it works. 
- 3 limit switch design has been implemented.
- homing limit switch is problematic as, the slower the translation of the carriage, the more time must
	be allowed for the carriage to move away from the limit sitch and unpress it.
